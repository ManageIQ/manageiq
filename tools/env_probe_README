The environment probe consists of three files:
script/env_probe 
	Wrapper shell script that runs the ruby scripts and tars up the resulting logs and yaml files.

script/env_probe_vc_inv.rb
	Ruby script that Connects to the specified VC and runs the same inventory that EVM does for a refresh. 
	It creates a log with debug trace level as  well as a yaml file containing the full inventory hash that was returned. 
	The yaml file can be loaded in ruby console for further analysis or processed into a real VMDB.

	Output: 
	log/env_probe_vc_inv.log
	log/env_probe_vc_inv.yml

script/env_probe_event_catcher.rb
	Event catcher simulation ruby script. This script connects to the specified Virtual Center and catches and logs events to a 
	log file until ^C is entered from the console.

	Output:
	log/env_probe_event_catcher.log

Execution Instructions:
	From the vmdb directory run the probes with the following command line: 
	
	       script/env_probe <vc host name or ip@> <vc user id> <vc password>

	The script will run the VC inventory probe followed by the event catcher probe. The event catcher will run until ^C is entered. Let it run until a 
	few events are caught. Once the event catcher probe exits the 2 log files and yaml file will automatically be tarred up in a file named 
	env_probe_results_<vc host name or ip@>.tar in the vmdb directory.
