# Description: This method sends an e-mail when the following event is raised:
#
# Events: vm_provisioned
#
# Model Notes:
# 1. to_email_address - used to specify an email address in the case where the
#    vm's owner does not have an  email address. To specify more than one email
#    address separate email address with commas. (I.e. admin@company.com,user@company.com)
# 2. from_email_address - used to specify an email address in the event the
#    requester replies to the email
# 3. signature - used to stamp the email with a custom signature
#
