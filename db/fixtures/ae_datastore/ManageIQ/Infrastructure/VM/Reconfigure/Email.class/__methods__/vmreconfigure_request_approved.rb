# Get miq_request object
miq_request = $evm.root['miq_request']

raise 'miq_request missing' if miq_request.nil?

# Build email to requester with reason
$evm.log('info', 'Requester email logic starting')

# Get requester email
requester = $evm.root['miq_request'].requester

# Get to_email_address from requester.email then from model if nil
to = requester.email || $evm.object['to_email_address']

# Get from_email_address from model unless specified below
from = $evm.object['from_email_address']

# Get signature from model unless specified below
signature = $evm.object['signature']

# Build subject
subject = "Request ID #{miq_request.id} - Your request to Reconfigure the Virtual Machine was Approved"

# Build email body
body = 'Hello, '
body += '<br>Your Virtual Machine VM Reconfiguration request was approved. '
body += '<br><br> Thank you,'
body += "<br> #{signature}"

$evm.log('info', "Sending email to <#{to}> from <#{from}> subject: <#{subject}>")
