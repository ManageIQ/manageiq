module ArLock
  # Creates a critical section around the specified block, in the style of
  # Mutex#synchronize, by locking on the database record in SQL.
  #
  # See ActiveRecord::Locking::Pessimistic#with_lock for details about
  #   the original version of this method.
  #
  # mode::    :exclusive or :shared (or :EX or :SH).  Default is :exclusive.
  #           :exclusive mode will prevent two database callers from entering
  #             the block concurrently.
  #           :shared mode will allow concurrent entry into the block, but will
  #             escalate to an :exclusive lock when ActiveRecord issues an
  #             update to the record.
  # timeout:: The amount of time, in seconds, before the block is timed out.
  #             This prevents the block from blocking others indefinitely.
  #             Default is 60 seconds.
