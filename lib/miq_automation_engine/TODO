TODO:

Product
	Convert Bill's VMworld Automation Demo to use Automation Engine
	Revamp VM Analysis to be driven by Automation Engine
	Leverage Automation Engine to derive scanning profiles

Engine
	Relationships
		Association
		Instantiation (Virtual Classes CANNOT have Instances)
	
		Edge Conditions
			Process .default Instance (virtual instance constructed from the schema defaults)
			Process Missing_Class
	
	Workspace
		Access objects by Name
			Substitution
			Method Access --> $evm.object()
		Object Visibility

	Methods (Synchronous vs. Asynchronous; External vs. Inline)
		Method Services
		===============
	
		# Logging
		EVMAUDIT
	
		# VMDB Accessors
		Add VMDB Automation Services (internal objects matching main CIs in VMDB for methods to use)
		VMDBGET
		VMDBSET?
	
		# Virtual Center Actions (to replace Bill's scripts)
		Add Automation Services to replace Bill's use of the VMware Perl Library
		
		
Discovery

    Args as Hash
    Pass Wrapper Objects via URI
    Method Catalog
    Bootstrap via PROCESS class
    Multi-Instance Naming (subst) and Reference
    Default DisplayName is Ruby Humanized Name
    Add operation to aggregation attributes
	
Datastore
	Validating Import
	Import/Export via YAML
	Add support for system (read-only) fields
	Add support for Value Types other than String (e.g. boolean, integer, timestamp, date)

	EVM Services
	==============
	
	# Logging
	EVMLOG
	
	# Workspace Accessors
	EVMGETOBJECT ==> "pseudo-handle" to an Object in the Workspace
	EVMGET (from Workspace by Name)
	EVMSET (set attribute in object in the workspace)
