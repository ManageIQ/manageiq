# An AMQP Notification Receiver that uses Qpid to listen for messages.

  # * :capacity: The total number of messages that can be held locally before
  # fetching more from the broker (default=50)
  # * :duration: The length of time (in seconds) the receiver should wait for a
  # message from the broker before timing out (default=10 seconds)
