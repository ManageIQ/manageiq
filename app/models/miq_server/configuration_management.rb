  # The purpose of this method is to do special activation of things
  #   that can only happen once per server.  Normally, the
  #   Vmdb::Settings::Activator would be used, however the activations
  #   will end up occurring once per worker on the entire server, which
  #   can be detrimental.
  #
  #   As an example, ntp_reload works by telling systemctl to restart
  #   chronyd.  However, if this occurs on every worker, you end up with
  #   dozens of calls to `systemctl restart chronyd` simultaneously.
  #   Instead, this method will allow it to only happen once on
  #   the reload of settings in evmserverd.
