        # Terms:
        ##############
        # Fixed Edges - Are edges that cannot be removed from Graph, in our case these are edges caused by attributes
        #               that has to be present before saving the record. These are attributes that are part of the
        #               record identity (unique index of the DB record) and attributes validated for presence.
        # Feedback Edge Set - Is a set of edges that are causing a cycle in the graph
        # DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph
        #
        # Alghoritm:
        ##############
        # Building a Feedback Edge Set:
        # We will be building DAG from a Graph containing cycles, the algorithm is building a Feedback Edge Set by
        # adding edges to a DAG made from Fixed Edges, while checking if by adding a new edge we haven't created
        # a cycle in the graph.
        # Converting original graph to DAG:
        # Using the Feedback Edge Set, we remove the attributes causing cycles from the original graph. This way, we
        # get a DAG, but the DAG is missing attributes.
        # Using the Feedback Edge Set we create new Nodes, containing only removed attributes in a step before. These
        # nodes will be attached to Graph according to their dependencies. By saving these nodes, we will add the
        # missing relations.
