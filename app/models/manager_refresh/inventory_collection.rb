    # @param model_class [Class] A class of an ApplicationRecord model, that we want to persist into the DB or load from
    #        the DB.
    # @param manager_ref [Array] Array of Symbols, that are keys of the InventoryObject's data, inserted into this
    #        InventoryCollection. Using these keys, we need to be able to uniquely identify each of the InventoryObject
    #        objects inside.
    # @param association [Symbol] A Rails association callable on a :parent attribute is used for comparing with the
    #        objects in the DB, to decide if the InventoryObjects will be created/deleted/updated or used for obtaining
    #        the data from a DB, if a DB strategy is used. It returns objects of the :model_class class or its sub STI.
    # @param parent [ApplicationRecord] An ApplicationRecord object that has a callable :association method returning
    #        the objects of a :model_class.
    # @param strategy [Symbol] A strategy of the InventoryCollection that will be used for saving/loading of the
    #        InventoryObject objects.
    #        Allowed strategies are:
    #         - nil => InventoryObject objects of the InventoryCollection will be saved to the DB, only these objects
    #                  will be referable from the other InventoryCollection objects.
    #         - :local_db_cache_all => Loads InventoryObject objects from the database, it loads all the objects that
    #                                  are a result of a [<:parent>.<:association>, :arel] taking
    #                                  first defined in this order. This strategy will not save any objects in the DB.
    #         - :local_db_find_references => Loads InventoryObject objects from the database, it loads only objects that
    #                                        were referenced by the other InventoryCollections using a filtered result
    #                                        of a [<:parent>.<:association>, :arel] taking first
    #                                        defined in this order. This strategy will not save any objects in the DB.
    #         - :local_db_find_missing_references => InventoryObject objects of the InventoryCollection will be saved to
    #                                                the DB. Then if we reference an object that is not present, it will
    #                                                load them from the db using :local_db_find_references strategy.
    # @param custom_save_block [Proc] A custom lambda/proc for persisting in the DB, for cases where it's not enough
    #        to just save every InventoryObject inside by the defined rules and default saving algorithm.
    #
    #        Example1 - saving SomeModel in my own ineffective way :-) :
    #
    #            custom_save = lambda do |_ems, inventory_collection|
    #              inventory_collection.each |inventory_object| do
    #                hash = inventory_object.attributes # Loads possible dependencies into saveable hash
    #                obj = SomeModel.find_by(:attr => hash[:attr]) # Note: doing find_by for many models produces N+1
    #                                                              # queries, avoid this, this is just a simple example :-)
    #                obj.update_attributes(hash) if obj
    #                obj ||= SomeModel.create(hash)
    #                inventory_object.id = obj.id # If this InventoryObject is referenced elsewhere, we need to store its
    #                                               primary key back to the InventoryObject
    #             end
    #
    #        Example2 - saving parent OrchestrationStack in a more effective way, than the default saving algorithm can
    #        achieve. Ancestry gem requires an ActiveRecord object for association and is not defined as a proper
    #        ActiveRecord association. That leads in N+1 queries in the default saving algorithm, so we can do better
    #        with custom saving for now. The InventoryCollection is defined as a custom dependencies processor,
    #        without its own :model_class and InventoryObjects inside:
    #
    #            ManagerRefresh::InventoryCollection.new({
    #              :association       => :orchestration_stack_ancestry,
    #              :custom_save_block => orchestration_stack_ancestry_save_block,
    #              :dependency_attributes => {
    #                :orchestration_stacks           => [collections[:orchestration_stacks]],
    #                :orchestration_stacks_resources => [collections[:orchestration_stacks_resources]]
    #              }
    #            })
    #
    #        And the lambda is defined as:
    #
    #            orchestration_stack_ancestry_save_block = lambda do |_ems, inventory_collection|
    #              stacks_inventory_collection = inventory_collection.dependency_attributes[:orchestration_stacks].try(:first)
    #
    #              return if stacks_inventory_collection.blank?
    #
    #              stacks_parents = stacks_inventory_collection.data.each_with_object({}) do |x, obj|
    #                parent_id = x.data[:parent].load.try(:id)
    #                obj[x.id] = parent_id if parent_id
    #              end
    #
    #              model_class = stacks_inventory_collection.model_class
    #
    #              stacks_parents_indexed = model_class
    #                                         .select([:id, :ancestry])
    #                                         .where(:id => stacks_parents.values).find_each.index_by(&:id)
    #
    #              model_class
    #                .select([:id, :ancestry])
    #                .where(:id => stacks_parents.keys).find_each do |stack|
    #                parent = stacks_parents_indexed[stacks_parents[stack.id]]
    #                stack.update_attribute(:parent, parent)
    #              end
    #            end
    # @param custom_reconnect_block [Proc] A custom lambda for reconnect logic of previously disconnected records
    #
    #        Example - Reconnect disconnected Vms
    #            ManagerRefresh::InventoryCollection.new({
    #              :association            => :orchestration_stack_ancestry,
    #              :custom_reconnect_block => vms_custom_reconnect_block,
    #            })
    #
    #        And the lambda is defined as:
    #
    #            vms_custom_reconnect_block = lambda do |inventory_collection, inventory_objects_index, attributes_index|
    #              inventory_objects_index.each_slice(1000) do |batch|
    #                Vm.where(:ems_ref => batch.map(&:second).map(&:manager_uuid)).each do |record|
    #                  index = inventory_collection.object_index_with_keys(inventory_collection.manager_ref_to_cols, record)
    #
    #                  # We need to delete the record from the inventory_objects_index and attributes_index, otherwise it
    #                  # would be sent for create.
    #                  inventory_object = inventory_objects_index.delete(index)
    #                  hash             = attributes_index.delete(index)
    #
    #                  record.assign_attributes(hash.except(:id, :type))
    #                  if !inventory_collection.check_changed? || record.changed?
    #                    record.save!
    #                    inventory_collection.store_updated_records(record)
    #                  end
    #
    #                  inventory_object.id = record.id
    #                end
    #              end
    # @param delete_method [Symbol] A delete method that will be used for deleting of the InventoryObject, if the
    #        object is marked for deletion. A default is :destroy, the instance method must be defined on the
    #        :model_class.
    # @param dependency_attributes [Hash] Manually defined dependencies of this InventoryCollection. We can use this
    #        by manually place the InventoryCollection into the graph, to make sure the saving is invoked after the
    #        dependencies were saved. The dependencies itself are InventoryCollection objects. For a common use-cases
    #        we do not need to define dependencies manually, since those are inferred automatically by scanning of the
    #        data.
    #
    #        Example:
    #          :dependency_attributes => {
    #            :orchestration_stacks           => [collections[:orchestration_stacks]],
    #            :orchestration_stacks_resources => [collections[:orchestration_stacks_resources]]
    #          }
    #        This example is used in Example2 of the <param custom_save_block> and it means that our :custom_save_block
    #        will be invoked after the InventoryCollection :orchestration_stacks and :orchestration_stacks_resources
    #        are saved.
    # @param attributes_blacklist [Array] Attributes we do not want to include into saving. We cannot blacklist an
    #        attribute that is needed for saving of the object.
    #        Note: attributes_blacklist is also used for internal resolving of the cycles in the graph.
    #
    #        In the Example2 of the <param custom_save_block>, we have a custom saving code, that saves a :parent
    #        attribute of the OrchestrationStack. That means we don't want that attribute saved as a part of
    #        InventoryCollection for OrchestrationStack, so we would set :attributes_blacklist => [:parent]. Then the
    #        :parent will be ignored while saving.
    # @param attributes_whitelist [Array] Same usage as the :attributes_blacklist, but defining full set of attributes
    #        that should be saved. Attributes that are part of :manager_ref and needed validations are automatically
    #        added.
    # @param complete [Boolean] By default true, :complete is marking we are sending a complete dataset and therefore
    #        we can create/update/delete the InventoryObject objects. If :complete is false we will only do
    #        create/update without delete.
    # @param update_only [Boolean] By default false. If true we only update the InventoryObject objects, if false we do
    #        create/update/delete.
    # @param check_changed [Boolean] By default true. If true, before updating the InventoryObject, we call Rails
    #        'changed?' method. This can optimize speed of updates heavily, but it can fail to recognize the change for
    #        e.g. Ancestry and Relationship based columns. If false, we always update the InventoryObject.
    # @param arel [ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy|Arel::SelectManager] Instead of :parent and :association
    #        we can provide Arel directly to say what records should be compared to check if InventoryObject will be
    #        doing create/update/delete.
    #
    #        Example:
    #        for a targeted refresh, we want to delete/update/create only a list of vms specified with a list of
    #        ems_refs:
    #            :arel => manager.vms.where(:ems_ref => manager_refs)
    #        Then we want to do the same for the hardwares of only those vms:
    #             :arel => manager.hardwares.joins(:vm_or_template).where(
    #               'vms' => {:ems_ref => manager_refs}
    #             )
    #        And etc. for the other Vm related records.
    # @param builder_params [Hash] A hash of an attributes that will be added to every inventory object created by
    #        inventory_collection.build(hash)
    #
    #        Example: Given
    #          inventory_collection = InventoryCollection.new({
    #            :model_class    => ::Vm,
    #            :arel           => @ems.vms,
    #            :builder_params => {:ems_id => 10}
    #          })
    #        And building the inventory_object like:
    #            inventory_object = inventory_collection.build(:ems_ref => "vm_1", :name => "vm1")
    #        The inventory_object.data will look like:
    #            {:ems_ref => "vm_1", :name => "vm1", :ems_id => 10}
    # @param inventory_object_attributes [Array] Array of attribute names that will be exposed as readers/writers on the
    #        InventoryObject objects inside.
    #
    #        Example: Given
    #                   inventory_collection = InventoryCollection.new({
    #                      :model_class                 => ::Vm,
    #                      :arel                        => @ems.vms,
    #                      :inventory_object_attributes => [:name, :label]
    #                    })
    #        And building the inventory_object like:
    #          inventory_object = inventory_collection.build(:ems_ref => "vm1", :name => "vm1")
    #        We can use inventory_object_attributes as setters and getters:
    #          inventory_object.name = "Name"
    #          inventory_object.label = inventory_object.name
    #        Which would be equivalent to less nicer way:
    #          inventory_object[:name] = "Name"
    #          inventory_object[:label] = inventory_object[:name]
    #        So by using inventory_object_attributes, we will be guarding the allowed attributes and will have an
    #        explicit list of allowed attributes, that can be used also for documentation purposes.
    # @param name [Symbol] A unique name of the InventoryCollection under a Persister. If not provided, the :association
    #        attribute is used. If :association is nil as well, the :name will be inferred from the :model_class.
    # @param saver_strategy [Symbol] A strategy that will be used for InventoryCollection persisting into the DB.
    #        Allowed saver strategies are:
    #        - :default => Using Rails saving methods, this way is not safe to run in multiple workers concurrently,
    #          since it will lead to non consistent data.
    #        - :batch => Using batch SQL queries, this way is not safe to run in multiple workers
    #          concurrently, since it will lead to non consistent data.
    #        - :concurrent_safe => This method is designed for concurrent saving. It uses atomic upsert to avoid
    #          data duplication and it uses timestamp based atomic checks to avoid new data being overwritten by the
    #          the old data.
    #        - :concurrent_safe_batch => Same as :concurrent_safe, but the upsert/update queries are executed as
    #          batched SQL queries, instead of sending 1 query per record.
    # @param parent_inventory_collections [Array] Array of symbols having a name pointing to the
    #        ManagerRefresh::InventoryCollection objects, that serve as parents to this InventoryCollection. There are
    #        several scenarios to consider, when deciding if InventoryCollection has parent collections, see the example.
    #
    #        Example:
    #          taking inventory collections :vms and :disks (local disks), if we write that:
    #          inventory_collection = InventoryCollection.new({
    #                       :model_class                 => ::Disk,
    #                       :association                 => :disks,
    #                       :manager_ref                 => [:vm, :location]
    #                       :parent_inventory_collection => [:vms],
    #                     })
    #
    #          Then the decision for having :parent_inventory_collection => [:vms] was probably driven by these
    #          points:
    #          1. We can get list of all disks only by doing SQL query through the parent object (so there will be join
    #             from vms to disks table).
    #          2. There is no API query for getting all disks from the provider API, we get them inside VM data, or as
    #             a Vm subquery
    #          3. Part of the manager_ref of the IC is the VM object (foreign key), so the disk's location is unique
    #             only under 1 Vm. (In current models, this modeled going through Hardware model)
    #          4. In targeted refresh, we always expect that each Vm will be saved with all its disks.
    #
    #          Then having the above points, adding :parent_inventory_collection => [:vms], will bring these
    #          implications:
    #          1. By archiving/deleting Vm, we can no longer see the disk, because those were owned by the Vm. Any
    #             archival/deletion of the Disk model, must be then done by cascade delete/hooks logic.
    #          2. Having Vm as a parent ensures we always process it first. So e.g. when providing no Vms for saving
    #             we would have no graph dependency (no data --> no edges --> no dependencies) and Disk could be
    #             archived/removed before the Vm, while we always want to archive the VM first.
    #          3. For targeted refresh, we always expect that all disks are saved with a VM. So for targeting :disks,
    #             we are not using #manager_uuids attribute, since the scope is "all disks of all targeted VMs", so we
    #             always use #manager_uuids of the parent. (that is why :parent_inventory_collections and
    #             :manager_uuids are mutually exclusive attributes)
    #          4. For automatically building the #targeted_arel query, we need the parent to know what is the root node.
    #             While this information can be introspected from the data, it creates a scope for create&update&delete,
    #             which means it has to work with no data provided (causing delete all). So with no data we cannot
    #             introspect anything.
    # @param manager_uuids [Array|Proc] Array of manager_uuids of the InventoryObjects we want to create/update/delete. Using
    #        this attribute, the db_collection_for_comparison will be automatically limited by the manager_uuids, in a
    #        case of a simple relation. In a case of a complex relation, we can leverage :manager_uuids in a
    #        custom :targeted_arel. We can pass also lambda, for lazy_evaluation.
    # @param all_manager_uuids [Array] Array of all manager_uuids of the InventoryObjects. With the :targeted true,
    #        having this parameter defined will invoke only :delete_method on a complement of this set, making sure
    #        the DB has only this set of data after. This :attribute serves for deleting of top level
    #        InventoryCollections, i.e. InventoryCollections having parent_inventory_collections nil. The deleting of
    #        child collections is already handled by the scope of the parent_inventory_collections and using Rails
    #        :dependent => :destroy,
    # @param targeted_arel [Proc] A callable block that receives this InventoryCollection as a first argument. In there
    #        we can leverage a :parent_inventory_collections or :manager_uuids to limit the query based on the
    #        manager_uuids available.
    #        Example:
    #          targeted_arel = lambda do |inventory_collection|
    #            # Getting ems_refs of parent :vms and :miq_templates
    #            manager_uuids = inventory_collection.parent_inventory_collections.collect(&:manager_uuids).flatten
    #            inventory_collection.db_collection_for_comparison.hardwares.joins(:vm_or_template).where(
    #              'vms' => {:ems_ref => manager_uuids}
    #            )
    #          end
    #
    #          inventory_collection = InventoryCollection.new({
    #                                   :model_class                 => ::Hardware,
    #                                   :association                 => :hardwares,

    #                                 })
    # @param targeted [Boolean] True if the collection is targeted, in that case it will be leveraging :manager_uuids
    #        :parent_inventory_collections and :targeted_arel to save a subgraph of a data.
    # @param manager_ref_allowed_nil [Array] Array of symbols having manager_ref columns, that are a foreign key an can
    #        be nil. Given the table are shared by many providers, it can happen, that the table is used only partially.
    #        Then it can happen we want to allow certain foreign keys to be nil, while being sure the referential
    #        integrity is not broken. Of course the DB Foreign Key can't be created in this case, so we should try to
    #        avoid this usecase by a proper modeling.
    # @param use_ar_object [Boolean] True or False. Whether we need to initialize AR object as part of the saving
    #        it's needed if the model have special setters, serialize of columns, etc. This setting is relevant only
    #        for the batch saver strategy.
    # @param batch_extra_attributes [Array] Array of symbols marking which extra attributes we want to store into the
    #        db. These extra attributes might be a product of :use_ar_object assignment and we need to specify them
    #        manually, if we want to use a batch saving strategy and we have models that populate attributes as a side
